# Malware-Detection in android applications

## About

* Permissions based Machine Learning model to detect whether an apk file is malware.
* Used Androguard tool to decompile apks. (https://github.com/androguard/androguard).

## Usage

* Step-1 Clone this repository.
* Step-2 Open terminal in Malware-Detection directory.
* Step-3 Run the following command "pip install -U androguard"
* Step 4 Install all the required packages using command - "sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
* Step-5 Run the follwing command - "python detector.apk path_to_apk"

## Limitations

* Not trained on latest apk files.
* Only considers permissions in apk files to generate results.

## Future work includes

* Use of latest dataset to train the model.
* More detailed hyperparameter tuning for the models
* Training Deep-Learning based model for better results.
